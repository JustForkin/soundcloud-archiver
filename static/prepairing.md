great, your archive is being synced now.

one cool thing about dat is it can [make websites](https://beakerbrowser.com/) which can’t be shutdown by anyone except you. if you’d like, you can automatically self-publish your profile with all your tunes.

to do that, [download beaker browser](http://beakerbrowser.com). install and open it, and instead of entering a normal website url, go to this one:

**dat://{{DATURL}}**

you’ll start seeing your tracks there as they download! you can send that link to anyone you want, and they can see them too.

oh yeah, and you can edit the index.html to make it look however you want.
