great, your archive is being synced now.

one cool thing about dat is it can [make websites](https://beakerbrowser.com/) which can’t be shutdown by anyone except you. if you’d like, you can automatically self-publish your profile with all your tunes.

to do that, [download beaker browser](http://beakerbrowser.com). install, open it, and instead of entering a normal website url, go to this one:

**dat://{{DATURL}}**

you’ll start seeing your tracks there as they download! you can send that link to anyone you want, and they can see them too.

want to know what’s cool about this? once your archive has finished syncing, you can click [fork](https://beakerbrowser.com/2017/06/14/forking-websites-on-the-p2p-web.html) to clone the archive and customize it however you want!

it’s a real website, so you can edit the code to make it look however you want.
